## Top Problems @ Development
 - I never worked with audio input, so initially read a alot about web audio api, confused which one to use Web Audio / Web Speech, still believe Web Speech would be a better approch.

 - I visualised the frequency pattern of the microphone still can't change the color of the circle because problem faced on how to handel the noise and how to recognize the talking with noise.

 - The final layout which one should be included. I added sinewave visualisation because I spend most of my time how to visualise the audio input.I don't want it go waste.
